# Phase-Functioned-Neural-Network-UE5
Recreating the phase functioned neural network in unreal engine 

Uses Daniel Holden research paper Phase-Functioned Neural Networks for Character Control 
https://theorangeduck.com/media/uploads/other_stuff/phasefunction.pdf


The goal of this project is to recreate this paper in a real-time game engine, the orignal paper uses opengl, with glm and eigen additional libraries 

this repository already has the additional library used in the orignal paper, the libraries are integrated using unreal's uPlugin method.
